        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          In 2025, we've moved beyond the question of whether AI will integrate
          into our workflows. The question now is, how fast can you adapt?
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          From GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT plugins, AI co-pilots are not replacing
          developers—they're redefining what productivity looks like. And the
          shift isn't just technical. It's cultural, strategic, and deeply
          personal.

          Co-pilots Are Becoming the New Default, Not a Bonus
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          AI co-pilots like GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and even
          Notion's AI assistant are no longer side tools—they're becoming the
          baseline expectations of modern development.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Developers now code faster by skipping boilerplate. Product designers
          iterate ideas with AI wireframing suggestions. Customer support reps
          draft entire help responses with tone control via co-pilot extensions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          If you're still doing everything from scratch, you're not working
          harder, you're falling behind.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Co-pilots are trained on billions of examples, giving you an augmented
          sense of possibility. But here's the twist: they amplify your
          strengths and your blind spots. Feeding them bad logic? You'll get
          fast, polished garbage.

          Human Context Is the New Leverage
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The age of co-pilots isn't about knowing how to prompt better. It's
          about developing systems thinking, understanding where automation ends
          and where critical thinking begins.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Anyone can ask an AI to "write a function." But fewer know how to
          break a problem down into stages, test assumptions, or build systems
          that adapt to edge cases.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          That's where the new edge lies: humans who blend deep context with
          clear instructions become 10x faster, 10x clearer, and 10x more
          strategic.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          So, if you're in tech today, your question should be: "How do I think
          like someone who gives great instructions, not just to people, but to
          machines?

            Conclusion: From Tool Users to System Designers
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            AI co-pilots are not coming for your job—they're coming for the
            parts of your job you never liked anyway. The grunt work. The setup.
            The repetitive requests. What remains is higher-level judgment,
            strategic creativity, and leadership.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            But here's the thing: this shift is not optional. The teams that are
            winning now aren't just learning new tools, they're building new
            workflows. They're creating environments where AI isn't just used
            but trusted and optimized. In those environments, productivity soars
            and time-to-market shrinks.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The future isn't AI vs. human. It's AI plus human—with humans who
            understand what the AI can't do becoming the most valuable players
            in tech.
