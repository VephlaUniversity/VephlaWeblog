          Computing at the Edge
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Edge computing is transforming how we think about data processing and
          application delivery. By moving computation closer to where data is
          generated, we're seeing dramatic improvements in performance and user
          experience.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          In 2025, edge computing has moved from experimental to essential, with
          companies like Cloudflare, Vercel, and AWS leading the charge in
          making edge deployment accessible to developers.

          Why Edge Matters Now
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Traditional cloud computing involves sending requests to centralized
          data centers, often hundreds of miles away. Edge computing processes
          data locally, reducing latency from 100ms+ to under 10ms.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          This isn't just about speed—it's about enabling new categories of
          applications: real-time gaming, AR/VR experiences, IoT processing, and
          AI inference at scale.

            The Developer Impact
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For developers, edge computing means rethinking application
            architecture. Static sites become dynamic, serverless functions run
            globally, and databases replicate across regions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Tools like Next.js Edge Runtime, Deno Deploy, and Cloudflare Workers
            are making it easier than ever to deploy applications that run
            everywhere, instantly.
