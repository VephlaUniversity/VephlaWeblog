          The Knowledge Management Battle
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          After using both Notion and Obsidian for over a year each, I can tell
          you they serve different purposes despite being lumped together as
          "note-taking apps."
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Notion is a Swiss Army knifeâ€”databases, wikis, project management, and
          notes all in one. Obsidian is a precision instrument for thinking and
          connecting ideas.

          When to Choose Notion
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Choose Notion if you need a collaborative workspace that combines
          notes with project management. Its database features are unmatched for
          organizing structured information.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Perfect for: Team wikis, content calendars, CRM systems, and any
          scenario where you need to share and collaborate on structured data.

          When to Choose Obsidian
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Choose Obsidian for personal knowledge management and research. Its
          linking system creates a "second brain" that helps you discover
          connections between ideas.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Perfect for: Research, writing projects, personal knowledge bases, and
          anyone who thinks in networks rather than hierarchies.

          <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I use both. Notion for project management and team collaboration,
            Obsidian for research and personal knowledge building. They
            complement rather than compete.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Start with whichever matches your primary use case, but don't be
            afraid to use both if they serve different aspects of your workflow.
