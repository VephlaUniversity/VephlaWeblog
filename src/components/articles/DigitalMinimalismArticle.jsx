        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          In 2024, I had 73 apps on my phone, 12 productivity tools, and
          countless browser tabs open. My attention was scattered, and my
          productivity was at an all-time low.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Today, I use 15 apps, 3 core tools, and maintain a single-tab policy.
          The result? 40% increase in deep work hours and significantly reduced
          digital anxiety.

          The Minimalist Stack
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          My entire productivity system now runs on three tools: Notion for
          knowledge management, Todoist for task tracking, and Calendar for time
          blocking.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The key insight: every additional tool introduces cognitive overhead.
          The best system is the one you actually use consistently.

          <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Start with a digital declutter: remove all non-essential apps,
            unsubscribe from newsletters you don't read, and establish
            phone-free zones in your home.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The goal isn't digital asceticismâ€”it's creating space for what
            matters most. When you reduce digital noise, you amplify your
            capacity for deep, meaningful work.
