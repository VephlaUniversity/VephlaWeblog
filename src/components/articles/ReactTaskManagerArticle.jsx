          Building a Production-Ready Task Manager
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This comprehensive guide walks through building a fully functional
          task manager using React, covering everything from basic component
          structure to advanced state management and local storage integration.
          You'll learn essential React concepts while building something
          practical that demonstrates real-world application architecture and
          best practices.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          We'll start with a simple task list and progressively add features
          like filtering, sorting, categories, due dates, and persistence. Each
          step builds upon the previous one, showing how to structure a React
          application that can grow and evolve over time. The final application
          will be fully responsive, accessible, and ready for production use.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          This project teaches essential React concepts through practical
          application: component composition, state management, effect handling,
          custom hooks, and performance optimization. You'll understand not just
          how to build features, but why certain architectural decisions matter
          for maintainability and scalability.

          Core Features and Architecture
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Our task manager will include all the features users expect from a
          modern productivity application, implemented using React best
          practices. Each feature demonstrates different aspects of React
          development, from basic state management to complex user interactions
          and data persistence.
        </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-4">
            Essential Features:
          </h3>
          <ul className="text-green-400 space-y-2">
            <li>• Add, edit, and delete tasks with rich text descriptions</li>
            <li>• Mark tasks as complete/incomplete with visual feedback</li>
            <li>• Filter tasks by status (all, active, completed)</li>
            <li>• Sort tasks by priority, due date, or creation time</li>
            <li>• Organize tasks into categories with color coding</li>
            <li>• Set due dates with overdue indicators</li>
            <li>• Persist data with localStorage and sync across tabs</li>
            <li>• Clean, responsive UI with smooth animations</li>
            <li>• Keyboard shortcuts for power users</li>
            <li>• Bulk operations (select multiple tasks)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The application architecture follows React best practices with a clear
          separation of concerns. We'll use custom hooks for business logic,
          context for global state, and compound components for flexible UI
          composition. This structure makes the codebase maintainable and
          testable.

          State Management Strategy
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          We'll implement a sophisticated state management solution using
          React's built-in capabilities rather than external libraries. This
          approach demonstrates how far you can go with useState, useReducer,
          and useContext before needing additional tools. The state structure
          supports complex operations while remaining predictable and
          debuggable.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The task list will be stored in component state and synchronized with
          localStorage for persistence. We'll implement optimistic updates for
          better user experience, undo functionality for mistake recovery, and
          conflict resolution for multi-tab scenarios. All state changes will be
          immutable and trackable.

          This state management approach scales well as the application grows.
          New features can be added by extending the reducer with new action
          types, and the predictable state updates make debugging
          straightforward. The localStorage integration ensures user data
          persists across sessions.

        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The component structure emphasizes reusability and composition. We'll
          build small, focused components that can be combined in different
          ways, following the single responsibility principle. This approach
          makes the codebase easier to test, debug, and extend with new
          features.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Key components include TaskItem for individual tasks, TaskList for
          collections, TaskForm for creation and editing, FilterBar for task
          filtering, and various UI components for buttons, inputs, and modals.
          Each component has a clear interface and minimal dependencies, making
          them easy to understand and modify.

          This architecture makes it easy to customize the task manager for

          application. The custom hooks encapsulate complex logic and make it
          reusable across components.
